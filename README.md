eJSON & XObjects
================

THIS README DESCRBIBES THE *GOAL* - THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY ALL THERE & WORKING YET.. ;-)

eJSON is a JSON Editor Plug-In for Eclipse. It is implemented with Xtext.

XObjects is an Editor Plug-In for Eclipse for a "Data DSL".
XObjects' syntax is JSON-inspired, but -optionally- allows 'strong typing' with editor support.
XObjects' types can be EMF Ecore, Java classes or XML Schema (XSD) [and may be extensible].
XObjects can gen. as JSON, XML or dynamic (hot reloadable) + static Java objects.
