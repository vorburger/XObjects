* overly simplistic Grammar, create Generator and Interpreter & Test Outlines...
* write complete Grammar..
* Compiler / Generator
* Interpreter
* create parsing tests - don't care about editor yet
* sandbox-xobjects stuff should move into ch.vorburger.xobjects ASAP!
* create XObjectsJvmModelInferrer.. e.g. for Documentation to be visible!

* intro. Named XObjects, like MWE2 & EFactory, use "Class name" (without colon)
* test // and /* */ comments

---
UI

* first look at some Xtend examples for SWT/GWT/JavaFX/Swing..

* what was the problem with MUI again, why data-binding needed? "you can regenerate the graphics after each command instead of incrementally sync'ing view and model."

---
LATER

* add native EMF support - find out how/from where http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/efactory/ gets at the eCore EClass 

* create ch.vorburger.ejson project
* create eJSON grammar, look at examples I looked at earlier 
* create parsing tests - don't care about editor
* learn about opening *.json in reflective editor
* make XObjects grammar extend eJSON 

* try with/apply to http://wazaabi.org, watch http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fosdem/2012/lightningtalks/Wazaabi.webm ?
	try it on http://generic-concept.com/blogs/olivier/?p=3 ?

* Validation rule & Quick Fix to ensure that resource filename is same as root XObject name, and XObject package is same as file's last trailing directory nameS
