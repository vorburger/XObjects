EFactory Testing Feedback & Ideas

* Bienz email / -> Git?

* Tycho build.. ACTUALLY.. how does Xtext/Xtend get built?! Tycho? Buckminster?

* NewObject {} optional?

* Validation (better even no Syntax completion) if no name mapper (e.g. if object doesn't have name)
  instead of a late exception when opened with EMF Editor and changing name only then 

* Validation (better even no Syntax completion) that if ID name given on top, should not allow it inside again!

* Outline!!

* Avoid several multipleProperty+= and introduce JSON-like [] syntax instead.. optional/additional, or change instead

* JSON Generator (without using any JSON Framework.. for performance, best to just use simplest String-based text writing 

* Bug? com.googlecode.efactory.serialization.ValueSwitch.caseBigDecimal(BigDecimal) conversion to double looks a little suspicious to me

* Bug Doc: No more keyword "new" in current grammar

XObjects 

* write tests for and support simple properties
* write tests for and support nested objects
* write tests for and support multi-value (multiplicity many) nested objects

* sandbox-xobjects stuff should move into ch.vorburger.xobjects ASAP!
* create XObjectsJvmModelInferrer.. e.g. for cross-refs & documentation to be visible? re-read http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation.html#xbaseInferredType

* test // and /* */ comments
* test if imports actually work? remove for now if not immediately..

---
UI

* first look at some Xtend examples for SWT/GWT/JavaFX/Swing..

* what was the problem with MUI again, why data-binding needed? "you can regenerate the graphics after each command instead of incrementally sync'ing view and model."

---
LATER

* add native EMF support - find out how/from where http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/efactory/ gets at the eCore EClass 

* create ch.vorburger.ejson project
* create eJSON grammar, look at examples I looked at earlier 
* create parsing tests - don't care about editor
* learn about opening *.json in reflective editor
* make XObjects grammar extend eJSON 

* try with/apply to http://wazaabi.org, watch http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fosdem/2012/lightningtalks/Wazaabi.webm ?
	try it on http://generic-concept.com/blogs/olivier/?p=3 ?

* Validation rule & Quick Fix to ensure that resource filename is same as root XObject name, and XObject package is same as file's last trailing directory nameS
